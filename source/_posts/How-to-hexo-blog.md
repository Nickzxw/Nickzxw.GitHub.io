# Make a new document

If our file's name is "hello hexo", you can type the following command in **Git GUI** to create  a new file.



```markdown
$ hexo new "hello hexo"
```



The result of the command is to create a new "hello-hexo.md" file under the **PATH:** ./hexo/sourse/_post.



Then we can start our writing!



# Document format

We use the Text Editor to open the new file "hello-hexo.md".



```markdown
---
title: hello hexo
date: 2021-10-25 20:51:15
tags: 
categories: 
---
```



The text of **title** is the file name and the title of the article.



And the value of the **date** is the local time when we created the file.



Besides, the value of **tags** is the label of the file, you can assign the value to the file at will. Like:



```markdown
---
title: hello hexo
date: 2021-10-25 20:51:15
tags: 
- hello
- hexo
- markdown
categories: 
---
```



In the end, **categories** are used to categorize articles.



# Resource reference

Sometimes we will want to insert a picture to our blog.



You will have two options:



1. Use absolute paths to reference resources.
2. Use relative paths to reference resources



## Article resource folder

If you use the relative paths to reference resources, you can use the article resource folder provided from Hexo.



Use the text editor to open the **"_config.yml"** file in the root directory, and set the **"post_asset_folder"**  values to true



```markdown
post_asset_folder: true
```



Then when you type `hexo new filename`, Hexo will create a new directory to allow us to save our resources.



## Tag plugin

We can reference pictures and other resources by using the tag plugin provided by Hexo.



```markdown
{% asset_path slug %}
{% asset_img slug [title] %}
{% asset_link slug [title] %}
```



The correct way to cite pictures:



```markdown
{% asset_img example.jpg This is an example image %}
```



# Article Summary

In order to set the article summary, we only need to add `<!-- more -->` after the content that we want to display as a summary. Like:



```markdown
---
title: hello hexo
date: 2021-10-25 20:51:15
tags: 
- hello
- hexo
- markdown
categories:
