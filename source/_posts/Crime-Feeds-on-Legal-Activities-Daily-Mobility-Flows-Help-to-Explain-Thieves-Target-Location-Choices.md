# Study Area

The data for the present research originates from <u>ZG City</u>, a city located in southeast China. ZG City has a total population in excess of 5 million, and is one of the largest and most developed cities of China.The study area is located in the central part of ZG City, and covers more than 3000 kilometers . 





# Theory

### **Crime Location Choice**

​	Crime location choice refers to an offender’s choice of where to perpetrate a crime (two  recent reviews are Bernasco and Ruiter 2014; Ruiter 2017).



### **Distance and Awareness Space**

​	Of all factors that affect crime location choices, distance is by far the most influential. Distance might also be considered a proxy measure of the offenders’ awareness space.



### **Crime Generators**

​	Crime generators and crime attractors are concepts in crime pattern theory that potentially play an important role in crime location choices. 



### **Social Disorganization**

​	Social disorganization has been identified as a community attribute that can apply to geographic areas of various sizes (e.g. street blocks, neighborhoods or districts). 



### **Mobility Flows**

According to opportunity theories of crime, the mobility of offenders is conditioned by the  mobility of the general population (Cohen and Felson 1979).





# Data and Methods

### Crime Data: Theft from the Person

​	Registered crime data were obtained from the police authorities of ZG City. All crime data  are recorded incidents of theft from the person (TFP) in which at least one offender was  arrested and prosecuted. It includes the date of the incident and the home addresses of the  offenders and the location where the offence was committed.



### Crime Generators

​	The list of potential crime generators is sheer endless, but included are those facilities  that seem most relevant based on the extant literature and taking into account the Chinese  context: the numbers of primary schools, middle schools, hospitals, basic stores, markets,  supermarkets, restaurants, cinemas, bars, banks, subway stations and bus stops per census unit. 

### Mobile Phone Data

​	To measure population mobility across the study area, we use the tracked data of mobile  phone users.

### Calculation of Mobility Streams

​	The resulting information was subsequently used to construct a measure of the volume of  mobility flows between all pairs of census units. The measure is defined as the number of  unique mobile phone users that visited both census units on the same day. Mobility flows  were calculated by summing phone users over all pairs of census units.

# Models

​	Following the large majority of previous location choice studies, we used the conditional  logit model to analyze the role of distance, crime generators and daily population mobility  in the offenders’ choice of locations for committing TFP. 

​	To  judge relative fit between multiple models, we use MdFadden’s Pseudo R2 , the Akaike’s  information criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) as benchmarks.

# Conclusion

​	The mobility flow measure is a useful addition to the estimated effects of distance and crime generators. It predicts the locations of thefts much better than the presence  of crime generators does. However, it does not replace the role of distance, suggesting that  offenders are more spatially restricted than others, or that even within their activity spaces  they prefer to offend near their homes.
